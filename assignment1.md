**What to do in case I face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior:**

2. Document the incidents: Write down details such as date, time, location, and a description of the behavior or incident.
3. Seek support: Talk to someone I trust, such as a friend, family member, or supervisor, about what I have experienced or witnessed.
4. Report the behavior: Inform the appropriate authority within my organization or institution, such as HR, a supervisor, or a designated reporting entity.
5. Preserve evidence: If possible, save any relevant messages, emails, or documents that could support my case.
6. Seek legal advice: Consult with an attorney or legal professional who specializes in workplace harassment to understand my rights and available options.
7. Practice self-care: Sexual harassment can be emotionally challenging, so I should prioritize my well-being and seek counseling or support services if needed.
